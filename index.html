            <p>This is me! Nice to meet you all. I'm from Peru, I'm currently 21 years old. I like to practice math and to know more about technology; also I like to listen to music, to play videogames, to walk and to read. I served on a mission for two years in the Peru Arequipa Mission. both my parents served on the same Mission, in the Peru Lima Norte mission. My older brother served as well, in the Guatemala Central mission. one of my goals in life is to be an expert in Technology, both hardware and software, as well as being an expert at math (I like math quite a lot). I am happy to have this opportunity to study at BYU.
